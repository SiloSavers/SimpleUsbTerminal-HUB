These are the FLO File exports for Automate that we are currently using for app automation. Each one does something slightly different to allow the app to run without constant need for supervision

In order to Import these files first download Automate from the Play Store and then drag and drop these files into the Download folder of the Phone. Open the Automate app click the 3 dots and Import and select the files. Be sure and Start each program (you may have to grant permissions when running for the first time).

"Launch Silo Savera on Display on" launches the app every time the screen turns on even without a lock screen
"Launch App on Unlock" launces the app on Unlock but does not work if there is no lock screen (Disable Lock Screen on One Plus: Settings -> System Settings -> Developer options (must be enabled) -> Do not use Lock screen)
"If not in Foreground run app" launches the app every 15 minutes if not in the Foreground
"Launch Silo Savers on Start" launches the app ever power cycle (Restart)
